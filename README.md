Project Overview:
The project involves the development of a .NET Core API that integrates with the Autoridade Tribut√°ria (AT) WSDL web services, allowing seamless communication between internal systems and the Portuguese Tax Authority's services. This API will facilitate the automatic submission and management of fiscal data, such as invoice series registration, ensuring compliance with the Portuguese tax legislation.
